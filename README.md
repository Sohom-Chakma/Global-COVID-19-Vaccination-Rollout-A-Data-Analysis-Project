A COVID-19 Vaccine Data Analysis using SQL and Tableau.

# Description:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and compare the success of COVID-19 vaccine rollout initiatives across different regions using SQL. By examining key metrics such as the percentage of the population vaccinated, the total number of people vaccinated, and each region's contribution to the global vaccination effort, this project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of vaccination campaigns worldwide.

# Requirements
- SSMS
- Tableau Public

# Data
COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data. The metrics we will be focusing on are:
- Continent
- Locations
- Population
- Date
- Deaths
- People vaccinated
[Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

# Methodology
- Data Exploration with SQL
- Visualization and dashboard with Tableau Public

# Results
## Global Numbers
- individuals vaccinated atleast once (not accounting for multiple doses + boosters): 5,685,252,607
- Total Deaths: 7,055,443
- Percentage of global population vaccinated:  ~70%

## Total Vaccination Count per Continent
Although, the count was affected by the size of the population, it is interesting to note that not all regions' vaccination rate was proportional.
- Asia: 3,689,438,297
- Africa: 555,027,330. Had the lowest vaccination rate out of all regions (~50%).
- Europe: 523,814,280
- North America: 458,563,506
- South America: 375,459,127
- Oceania: 28,960,501. Lowest vaccination count but largely due to smaller population. Vaccine initiatives were effective as it had ~80% of the population vaccinated.
